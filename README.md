## Projects I liked best
* [News Reader](https://github.com/lrazovic/advanced_programming): An RSS feed reader developed together with 4 other colleagues. I tried to bring the DevOps philosophy into the team and I was mainly responsible for the backend and the system architecture. A microservice application using Python with FastAPI with services communicating with REST and JSON-RPC all orchestrated using Docker Compose/Swarm.
* [NFT Swap](https://github.com/Andrea98Palermo/NFTswap): An NFT marketplace (developed together with 2 other colleagues) where instead of selling and buying NFT you can safely exchange them. The idea convinced us and also convinced several professors, so we decided to continue and founded the 
[Non-fungible-Guys](https://github.com/Non-fungible-Guys)  organisation, where we are continuing the development of both the contract (in Solidity) and the Frontend (React + Next.js). At the moment we are working on several EVM testnets and the frontend is on Cloudflare Pages.
* [OOTP (Open One-time Password)](https://github.com/odroe/ootp): A library (available for both Typescript and Rust) plus a frontend (in Flutter) to generate HOTP (HMAC-based One-time Password) and TOTP (Time-based One-time Password). 
* [`decode-git-object`](https://github.com/lrazovic/decode-git-object): A small utility that decodes git objects, mainly useful for forensics, recovery, and CTF challenges.
* [`rust_rsa`](https://github.com/lrazovic/rust_rsa): A simple RSA implementation in Rust developed to anchor theoretical concepts behind RSA.
* [`rusty-mqtt`](https://github.com/lrazovic/rusty-mqtt): A Rust bridge between the MQTT broker of TTN and ThingsBoard.
* [`rust-hmac-sha`](https://github.com/lrazovic/rust-hmac-sha): A pure Rust implementation of the Hash-based Message Authentication Code Algoritm for SHA-{1,2,3}. This project can be seen as an interface/wrapper for the RustCrypto crate, focusing on user/developer ease of use. Works in a #![no_std] environment.

> Building software systems is a constant wrestling match between ideals, pragmatism, aesthetics, and time. Reality never quite matches the ideal. Nothing is ever perfect, but things can be good.

*Curious about the origin of my surname? My grandfather was Croatian, from a nearby island [Split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia) (/ËˆsplÉªt/, as in the English word split)*
